[This](https://simon-holdorf.medium.com/how-to-stand-out-as-a-software-engineer-in-2021-insights-advice-803016bf8d38) is an article that I find to be very interesting and relevant now more than ever.

### Why do I like this article?
>*I find this article really interesting because one of the biggest details that it addresses, and that I am personally coming to realize by inching my way into this field, is that software engineering is not solely about coding and knowing how to code. It points out how being a software engineer requires a very well-rounded individual, who has public-speaking skills, problem-solving skills, can work in teams and be creative, among many other things. This is so relevant because I personally know so many people who strive to know every last detail about coding down to the smallest syntax technicalities, but being so focused on things like that can actually hinder aspiring software engineers from getting a job. This article also reminded me how fast things move in this field, such as having to learn on the spot and not to be comfortable just knowing two or three languages. Although it only briefly touches on AI, I am happy it did because it shows that AI is still such a growing subsidiary in this field that I can personally make great contributions in, either with a job or even on my own.*

*Wow, this article is very interesting, it will help me greatly as a software engineer (Bill Ziyan Lin)*
